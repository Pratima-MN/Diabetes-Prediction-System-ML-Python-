* Set up jupyter notebook in your system
* To implement accuracy model using LR method (Diabetes prediction accuracy)
   1. Download the csv file (diabetes.csv)
   2. Download the python file (Diabetes_prediction_LRmethos.ipynb)
   3. Open .ipynb file using jupyter notebook
   4. Check for the import commands and install packages if not installed on your system
   5. Copy the path of diabetes.csv file from your downloads and paste it in the command which reads csv file
       [ copy path and paste in : data = pd.read_csv(r'path') in python file ]
   6. Now execute all the cells in order 
   7. Last cell gives the accuracy of Diabetes prediction model using LR method
(Note : Diabetes prediction based on input values is done using front end by python and django, refer the next folder)
